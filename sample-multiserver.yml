# This is a sample configuration. To use it, copy it to local-configure.yml
# and edit.
#
# Multiserver configuration
# -------------------------
#
# This is an example of the techniques you may use to install multiple,
# separate Plone instances to the same server.
#
# Unlike with other examples, you won't want to use this without
# major changes to reflect your server needs.


# Things you MUST change
# ----------------------

admin_email:

plone_initial_password:

muninnode_query_ips:
    - ip.of.munin.monitor

# If you do not have a Munin monitor running, comment out the
# muninnode_query_ips and uncomment the line below:

# install_muninnode: no


# Major settings
# --------------

# Plone 4.3.x, 5.0.x, 5.1.x and 5.2.x are currently tested and working.
# Make sure this setting is quoted so that it's interpreted as a string.
plone_version: '5.2.1'

# 2 clients
plone_client_count: 2

# smallish
plone_zodb_cache_size: 15000

# and enforce that with a memory-monitor
plone_client_max_memory: 750MB

# it's 2020 now... Use Python 3
plone_python_version: "3"

# with Python 3, z2monitor should not be used
plone_client_tcpcheck: no

# Plone instance settings
# -----------------------
# Most settings can be either global or specific to a particular install.
# Specify specific settings in the "playbook_plones list".
# You must, at a minimum, specify specifics for plone_instance_name, which
# is used to distinguish instances, and the ZEO/ZEO client ports.
