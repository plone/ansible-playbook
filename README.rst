Plone Ansible playbook
======================

.. admonition:: Description

    Use Ansible to provision a full-stack Plone server


Introduction
------------

Plone's Ansible Playbook can completely provision a remote server to run the full stack of Plone, including:

* Plone in a cluster configuration;

* Automatic starting and process control of the Plone cluster with `supervisor <http://supervisord.org>`_;

* Load balancing of the cluster with `HAProxy <http://www.haproxy.org/>`_;

* Caching with `Varnish <https://www.varnish-cache.org/>`_;

* `Nginx <http://wiki.nginx.org/Main>`_ as a world-facing remote proxy and URL rewrite engine;

* An outgoing-mail-only mail server using `Postfix <http://www.postfix.org/>`_;

* Monitoring and log analysis with `munin-node <http://munin-monitoring.org/>`_ and `logwatch <http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/logwatch8.html>`_ and `fail2ban <http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page>`_.

* Use of a local `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_ provisioned via `vagrant <https://www.vagrantup.com/>`_ to test and model your remote server.

An ansible playbook and roles describe the desired condition of the server. The playbook is used both for initial provisioning and for updating.

See the ``docs`` subdirectory or `readthedocs <http://plone-ansible-playbook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ for complete documentation.

TL;DR
^^^^^

1. Install a current version of Ansible;

2. If you wish to test locally, install Vagrant and VirtualBox;

3. Check out or download a copy of this package;

4. Run ``ansible-galaxy -p roles -r requirements.yml install`` to install required roles;

5. Copy one of the ``sample*.yml`` files to ``local-configure.yml`` and edit as needed.

6. To test in a local virtual machine, run ``vagrant up`` or ``vagrant provision``;

7. Create an Ansible inventory file for the remote host (look at vbox_host.cfg for an example)

7.a To install python 2.7 on Ubuntu 15.04, which only comes with python 3, run ``ansible your_host_name -i myhost.cfg -m raw -a â€œapt-get -y install python-minimal"``;

7.b To deploy, run ``ansible-playbook --ask-sudo-pass -i myhost.cfg playbook.yml``;

8. Set a real password for your Plone instance on the target server;

9. Set up appropriate firewalls.
