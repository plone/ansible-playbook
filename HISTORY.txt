1.3.0 2018-03-10

    **Before you update***: If you're using version 1.2.x, you should note that version 1.3.0+ sets up client monitors for each ZEO client.
    These monitors will use the client port + 100.
    haproxy will use these monitor ports as a mechanism to check ZEO client status without using an http thread.
    See ``tcpcheck`` variables in the documentation for plone setup if you wish to alter or turn off this feature.

- Use plone server role 1.3.0.
  [smcmahon]

- Use five.z2monitor facilities to configure health check ports.
  plone_client_tcpcheck and plone_client_tcpcheck_port control this.
  See http://hvelarde.blogspot.com/2017/12/we-have-been-doing-health-checks-wrong.html for an excellent writeup on why this is a much better idea than http checks.
  Thanks, hvelarde!
  Note that this requires plone role v 1.3.0+.
